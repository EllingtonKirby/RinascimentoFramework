# Rinascimento Framework

This repository (will, apologies for the delay!) contain the framework for Game AI used in the "Rinascimento: Optimising Statistical Forward Planning Agents for Playing Splendor" paper.
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.01883.pdf

It implements the mechanics of the popular board game Splendor™ designed by Marc André and published by Space Cowboys in a parameterised way. This means that the game engine can play not only the exact real game but also the Splendor-like game.

For more details you can read the paper linked above or check out the slide deck the authors used during the IEEE Conference on Games 2019.

Bear in mind this is being developed as an accademic project just for research purposes.

Wiki and docs coming soon (-ish)!
