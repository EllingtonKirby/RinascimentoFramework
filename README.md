# Rinascimento Framework

This repository contains the Game AI framework based on the popular board game [Splendor](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor) designed by Marc Andr√© and published by Space Cowboys.
The engine allows the user to modify all the game design parameters to play a wide variety of _Splendor-like_ games, but also to create new game content and develop new game-playing agents.
Rinascimento intends to promote the development and benchmarking of several applications of Game AI, few examples being: game-playing, Procedural Content Generation, automated game design, agent hyperparameter tuning.

For more details you can read the material linked below.

If you are interested in running some experiments don't hesitate to contact me at my  [QMUL email address](mailto:i.bravi@qmul.ac.uk), I'm happy to help and support your research with Rinascimento!

Bear in mind this is being developed as an accademic project just for research purposes.

Wiki and docs coming soon(-ish)!

## Experiments

This repository contains a set of experiments and scripts I developed during my [IGGI PhD](iggi.org.uk). Here's a list:
* __Play Rinascimento__ games between AIs and/or user input with GUI;
* __Hyperparameter tuning__ using [NTBEA](https://github.com/SimonLucas/ntbea) or grid search algorithms;
* __Behavioural Search__ using the [MAP-Elites](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.04909.pdf) search (paper out soon);

## How to pronounce it

Being an Italian word I understand people may have some issue pronouncing it.

__Don't panic__, it's ok if you butcher it!

But if you wanted to learn here's how you would pronounce it if you were an English speaker: __reenah-she-ment-o__
